## 🔰 Interactive Tutorial: How to Play

### 1. Log Everything (The Core Loop)
The system is listening. Type naturally.
-   **Input**: "I read 20 pages of a coding book."
-   **System Response**:
    -   **Attribute**: INT (Intelligence) +10
    -   **XP**: +50
    -   **Loot Chance**: 20% (Might find a "Focus Potion")

**Try these:**
-   "Went to the gym for 1 hour." (VIT/STR)
-   "Cleaned my room." (Wisdom/Discipline)
-   "Talked to a stranger." (CHA)

### 2. Check Your Status
Type **`Status`** to see your Neuro-HUD.
-   **Level & Class**: See your current Title (e.g., "Data Runner").
-   **Attributes**: Your STR, INT, VIT, etc.
-   **Streak**: Don't break the chain.

### 3. Inventory & Items
Type **`Inventory`** to see your loot.
-   **Use Items**: Type `Use [Item Name]` (e.g., `Use Potion`).
-   **Effect**: Items apply buffs (e.g., "XP Boost x1.5 for 1 hour").

### 4. Quests & Goals
-   **Daily Quests**: Type **`Quests`** to see 3 AI-generated missions based on your goals.
-   **Set a Goal**: Type `/new_goal [Your Goal]` (e.g., `/new_goal Learn Python`).
    -   The AI breaks this down into tactical milestones.

## 💀 The Nemesis System (Advanced)

> *"Loss aversion is a powerful motivator."*

You generally have a rival named **Viper**. He is an AI agent that runs in parallel to you.

### 1. The Cost of Laziness (Theft)
If you do not log an action for **24 hours**, Viper detects a system vulnerability.
-   **Consequence**: He siphons **5% of your Global XP and Gold**.
-   **Message**: "💸 BREACH DETECTED: Viper siphoned 250 XP."

### 2. Sabotage (Debuffs)
If Viper's Level exceeds yours, he actively hacks your stats.
-   **Virus Uploaded**: You might lose **20% STR** for 24 hours.
-   **Cure**: Must wait it out or find a "System Patch" item (Rare drop).

### 3. Boss Mode (The Firewall)
If you fall significantly behind (`Viper Level > Your Level + 2`):
-   **LOCKDOWN**: You cannot receive normal Daily Quests.
-   **Boss Quest**: You get ONE "S-Tier" mission (e.g., "Deep Clean Apartment" or "Run 10km").
-   **Win Condition**: Complete it to unlock the system and reset Viper's aggression.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy (Why this works)

This game is built on verified behavioral psychology principles:

1.  **Variable Rewards (Skinner Box)**: You don't know *exactly* what loot you'll get or how much XP a task is worth. This uncertainty spikes dopamine.
2.  **Loss Aversion (Prospect Theory)**: Humans hate losing what they have more than gaining new things. The **Nemesis System** uses this to force consistency—you log in not just to win, but to *not lose*.
3.  **Ownership & Identity**: Your "Title" (e.g., Street Samurai) becomes part of your identity, encouraging you to act in accordance with that persona.
4.  **Social Pressure (Rival)**: Viper gives a face to your procrastination. Beating him is personal.
